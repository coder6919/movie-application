üé¨ MovieFlix: A Modern Movie Discovery App

MovieFlix is a sleek, responsive movie search and discovery application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It connects to the TMDB API for real-time movie data and uses Appwrite as a backend to log and count popular search terms.

Live Demo: https://movie-flix69.netlify.app/

‚ú® Key Features

Popular Movie Discovery: The homepage greets users with a list of the most popular movies, fetched directly from the TMDB API.

Animated Header Carousel: An infinite-scrolling carousel (built with CSS animations) showcases popular movies and is fully clickable.

Dynamic Search: A real-time search bar that uses useDebounce to prevent excessive API calls while the user is typing.

React Router v6: A modern, multi-page routing setup using react-router-dom to create distinct pages for the movie list (/) and movie details (/movie/:id).

Detailed Movie View: Clicking a movie card navigates to a dedicated details page, which loads additional information like genres, runtime, and an embedded YouTube trailer.

Appwrite Backend: Intelligently logs all unique search terms to an Appwrite database. If a term is searched again, its count is incremented instead of creating a new entry.

Responsive & Styled: Fully responsive design using Tailwind CSS and custom utility classes for a clean, dark-mode UI with gradient text and hover effects.

üöÄ Deployment to Netlify

This project is configured for a seamless deployment to Netlify.

Build Command: npm run build

Publish Directory: dist

Crucial Step: React Router Redirect

To ensure your React Router routes (like /movie/123) work correctly on Netlify, you must have a _redirects file.

Create a file named _redirects inside your public/ folder.

Add the following line to it:

/* /index.html    200


This tells Netlify to send all page requests to your index.html file, allowing React Router to handle the navigation.
